# üè• Multilingual Medical Dialogue Summarization and Question Answering System

## üìò Introduction

This project is part of the **NLP-AI4Health Shared Task (2025)**, focusing on **multilingual and low-resource NLP for healthcare**.  
It integrates two key components:

1. **Dialogue Summarization using mT5** ‚Äì generating concise summaries of multilingual medical dialogues.  
2. **Question Answering using RAG** ‚Äì providing accurate and safe medical responses through retrieval-augmented generation.

## üß† 1. Multilingual Medical Dialogue Summarization (mT5)

### üéØ Objective
Develop a system that summarizes patient‚Äìprovider dialogues into concise, clinically meaningful summaries while preserving essential medical information.

### üíæ Dataset (Closed Task)
The **SharedTask_NLPAI4Health_Train&Dev** dataset includes multilingual dialogues in domains like **Head and Neck Cancer** and **Cystic Fibrosis**.  
Each language folder contains dialogues (`.jsonl`), Q&A pairs, key‚Äìvalue summaries, and text summaries.
Our Github Repository Code:- https://github.com/addygeek/Nlp4Health-Samvad-Team-IIIT-Surat

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Open `generate_summaries.py` in **Google Colab (GPU runtime)**.
3. MyDrive/NLP_A14_Health/mT5_Baseline_Model/checkpoint-9135/
4. Model_Path:- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BloBv_EP8EG4EbpDg1wyz5n-UQupe5wU?usp=drive_link
5. Run all cells to produce `submission.zip` containing generated summaries.

### üìà Output
A fine-tuned **mT5 model** that generates concise, multilingual dialogue summaries.

## ü§ñ 2. Multilingual Medical Question Answering using RAG

### üîç Overview
The **Enterprise Multilingual Medical RAG System** combines retrieval and generation to provide multilingual, safe, and contextually accurate medical answers.  
It uses **`bigscience/bloomz-560m`** as the generation model.

### ‚ú® Key Features
- **Semantic Retrieval:** Embedding-based search using `SentenceTransformer` and FAISS.  
- **Answer Generation:** Context-aware response generation using multilingual MT5/BLOOMZ.  
- **Language Detection & Translation:** Handles multilingual inputs for consistent processing.  
- **Confidence Scoring:** Evaluates answer reliability using retrieval and linguistic metrics.  
- **Safety Validation:** Filters unsafe or restricted medical topics with severity-based alerts.  
- **Caching & Logging:** Speeds up repeat queries and maintains compliance logs.

### üß© Core Components
| Module | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Embedding Model** | SentenceTransformer (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) generates dense multilingual embeddings. |
| **Retriever** | FAISS (Inner Product) for efficient similarity search across QA datasets. |
| **Answer Generator** | MT5/BLOOMZ models generate patient-friendly answers with context awareness. |
| **Confidence Scorer** | Combines retrieval quality, language detection, and safety checks. |
| **Safety Guard** | Detects emergencies and restricted topics; ensures medical accuracy. |



### üîÑ RAG Pipeline Flow
1. **Embedding Generation:** Create dense, normalized embeddings for all QA pairs.  
2. **Retrieval:** Use FAISS to fetch top-K relevant entries with optional language filtering.  
3. **Answer Generation:** Generate safe, coherent answers using top contexts and prompts.  
4. **Confidence Scoring:** Compute reliability based on retrieval relevance and safety.

### üß∞ How to Run
1. Open `nlp4health_final_rag(1).py` in Google Colab.  
2. Update model and dataset paths in the notebook.  
3. Run all cells sequentially to execute the full RAG pipeline.
